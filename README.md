# CodeBird: Android app and web app for helping the migratory species

**CodeBird** is a proof of concept which aims to not only provide insights about the majestic, migratory bird - Siberian Crane but also sensitize more people for the conservation process.

## Getting Started
There are two portions: The Android app is in the Android folder and the web app is in the Website folder  
Same as any Android project. Built on Android Studio.  
Tested on deviecs till Andorid N.  
Backward compatibility: API 15.  
Web app has Node based backened and MongoDB to manage the database  

## How is this different  
Instead of just providing information and urging people to contribute, we have adopted a different approach.  
We try to involve the user in the process from the very beginning.  
Their are exciting activities performing which they would become more aware about these birds and how humans are affected by their survival.  
Users can also upload new sightings of these birds and compare their score with others on a leaderboard.  
This gamification of the conservation drive might help get more people involved in the process.
